<h2>My Top 3 Picks</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>This movie tops the list of my top 5 picks soley because of the acting and story line.
    The incorporation of the dragons, epic fight scenes,and dramatic love episodes were all mixed together in a beautiful way. Here is a list of the best actors and actresses in this series. 
</p>
 
<ul>
    <li>Tyrion Lanister</li>
    <li>John Snow</li>
    <li>Denerys targeryen</li>
    <li>Lord Tyrell</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>This has to be one of the greatest TV shows ever produces, particularly during the early 2000's. Considering that this series was among the first i ever watched,
    i have to admit that it was my introduction to the world of long TV series. Right from the choice of actors to the story line, if you are looking for a fun movie
    that will keep you at the edge of your seat, you have to give this one a try. Here are my favourite characters in this series.
</p>
<ol> 
    <li>Deontey Wilder</li>
    <li>Canello Alvarez</li>
    <li>Jarmell Charlo</li>
</ol>

<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>If you are a lover of the ancient Nordic mythgology, then you will immediately fall in love with this one. Vikings depicts the ways of the ancient scandinavian 
    vikings way of life. This series shows how the act of war and conquest was the bread and butter of this tribe. This waring tribe made their living invading and conquering
    other civilizations and taking all their valuables including land, silver and gold. Here are my top characters in this movie. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ragnar Lorthbrok</li>
    <li>Floki chihuahua</li>
    <li>Ivar the boneless</li>
    <li>Bjorn Ironside</li>
</ul>
